The EMOTE project was a three-year EU-FP7 project that aimed at creating empathic artificial tutors to be used in real classrooms.
These tutors serve as a tool for the teachers, by playing pedagogical games on the topics of map-reading, and sustainable development.
They are able to autonomously adapt to the students and guide them throughout the activities, while also relating the activity with the goals of the curriculum.
I participated in the architectural design, lead the development of the integration infrastructure, the main behaviour module, plus a control system and animations for the NAO robot.
