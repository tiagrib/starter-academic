The LIREC project was a five-year EU-FP7 project that aimed at creating robotic companions that could establish long-term relationships with humans with various applications such as entertainment, domestic or office environments.
I created the animation system used on the EMYS robot, which allowed to overlay and blend my animations, designed in 3dsmax, with posture overlays and head-tracking autonomously.
