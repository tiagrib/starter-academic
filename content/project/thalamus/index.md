Thalamus is a high-level integration framework aimed especially at developing interactive characters that interact both through virtual and physical components.
It works as an asynchronous messaging middle-ware and on well-defined message structures to provide a seamless plug-and-play-modules functionality.
Additionally, it works ”out of the box”, without requiring any installation, includes GUIs and debugging tools that make it apropriate for collaborative, academic and research development.
