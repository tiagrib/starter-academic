**Nutty** is a symbolic animation engine based on CGI methods that allows to animate both virtual and robotic characters. It is simultaneously a design-time and run-time environment, both for designing and programming animation, as well as to execute it in real-time during interaction. It runs either standalone, or as a plug-in, for which we currently support Autodesk 3dsmax.
